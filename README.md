Overview
This project focused on building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. We utilized a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, including various features such as transaction amount, time, and other relevant parameters.

The main objective was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. To achieve this, we employed popular machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

The process involved several key steps:

Data Preprocessing: We cleaned the dataset, performed feature engineering to extract relevant information, and applied scaling to standardize the data.

Model Training: We trained multiple machine learning models using the preprocessed data. These models were trained to learn patterns in the data that distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helped us identify the most effective algorithm for our specific task.

Model Selection: Based on the evaluation results, we selected the best-performing model that demonstrated the highest accuracy and reliability in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Model Deployment: Finally, we deployed the selected model, making it available for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-world scenarios.

Overall, this project aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance fraud detection capabilities in financial transactions, thereby minimizing the risk of fraudulent activity and protecting the interests of credit card users and financial institutions.
